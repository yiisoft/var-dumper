`VarDumper` enhances functionality of `var_dump()` and `var_export()`. It is dealing with recursive references,
may highlight syntax and export closures.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher.

## Installation

The package could be installed with composer:

```shell
composer require yiisoft/var-dumper --prefer-dist
```

## General usage

### Quick debugging

In case you want to echo a string representing variable contents use the following code:

```php
\Yiisoft\VarDumper\VarDumper::dump($variable);
```

That is useful for quick debugging. By default, it goes deep `10` levels into variable and highlights syntax. You may
adjust these settings via second and third argument of the method respectively.

For convenience, you can use the functions:

```php
// Prints variables:
d($variable, /* Further variables to dump. */);

// Prints variables and terminate the current script:
dd($variable, /* Further variables to dump. */);
```

### Formatting debug string

To get a string representing variable contents, same as above but without `echo`:

```php
$string = \Yiisoft\VarDumper\VarDumper::create($variable)->asString(10, true);
```

`10` is maximum recursion depth and `true` is telling dumper to
highlight syntax.

### Exporting as PHP code

In order to get a valid PHP expression string that can be evaluated by PHP parser,
and the evaluation result will give back the variable value, use the following code:

```php
$string = \Yiisoft\VarDumper\VarDumper::create($variable)->export();
```

It is similar to `var_export()` but uses short array syntax, handles closures, and serializes objects.

In the above `export()` will give you nicely formatted code. You can remove formatting by passing `false` as the first
`$format` argument.

`$useVariables` argument allows specifying array of variables that will be in `use` statement for closures.
That is especially useful if an object contains callbacks that should get info from upper scope.

`$serializeObjects` argument when given `false` allows to force turn off using of serialization for objects so instead
closures and reflection API are used the same was as for exporting closures. De-serialization performance is better.
Closures are way more readable.

### Exporting as JSON string

```php
$string = \Yiisoft\VarDumper\VarDumper::create($variable)->asJson();
```

It is similar to `json_encode()` but uses short array syntax, handles closures, and serializes objects.

In the above `asJson()` will give you nicely formatted code. You can remove formatting by passing `false` as the first
`$format` argument.

`$depth` argument allows you to set maximum recursion depth.

## Limitations

Current limitations are:

- Variables or properties that are anonymous classes or contain anonymous classes are not supported.    

### Unit testing

The package is tested with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). To run tests:

```shell
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Mutation testing

The package tests are checked with [Infection](https://infection.github.io/) mutation framework with
[Infection Static Analysis Plugin](https://github.com/Roave/infection-static-analysis-plugin). To run it:

```shell
./vendor/bin/roave-infection-static-analysis-plugin
```

### Static analysis

The code is statically analyzed with [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/). To run static analysis:

```shell
./vendor/bin/psalm
```
